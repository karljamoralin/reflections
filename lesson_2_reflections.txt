When I initialize a repository, a GIT directory is created. It looks like it contains the configurations necessary to run a GIT repository. If you don't do git init, your directory won't be a git repository, just a normal directory.

The staging area is like your shopping cart -- you add files you like to commit but you'll have a chance to review them before actually committing them to the repository. 

The staging area is useful in a sense that if you made changes in multiple files, you can add one at a staging area, then commit it before repeating the process to each one of the files. That way you'll have a separate commit for each changes you did in multiple files.
