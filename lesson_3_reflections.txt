When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share my code to others, I'll use a remote repository. 

You want to pull your changes manually so that you'll have a finer control when you want your local copy to be updated, in case you have codes locally that you don't want yet to be overwritten. 

Forks are used to create a copy of a repository from GitHub. It only functions inside GitHub. GitHub counts the number of forks made. Clone is used to copy a repository from GitHub or other sites to your local. Branch is to make a parallel version of your repository, useful for experimental features, bug fixes, without affecting the master.
